Installation instructions:

elephon requires the Boost libraries, the VTK libary, BLAS / LAPACK, fftw3  and cmake to be installed on the system.

###   HIPERGATOR specific   ###

load the following modules with the command

$ module load cmake gcc vtk fftw mkl boost/1.54.0

### END HIPERGATOR specific ###

To compile a production code binary, go to the elephon main folder and do

$ cd /path/to/your/elephon/main/dir
$ mkdir release
$ cd release
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBLAS="mkl" ../elephon
$ make
<optional> $ make test

the last make test will run the test-suite. It is recommended to check if everything is determined working on the current system.

==============================
Applications (prelimnary):

*** mass tensor calculation:


In order to use it to compute the mass tensor,
1) put a file, say 'infile', into a folder with the vasp calculation. The program reads the vasprun.xml (and the OUTCAR) if its there
2) into that file 'infile' put, e.g.

f_mtens = name_of_the_mass_tensor_file
fftd = 128 128 128
ewinbnd = -4.0 4.0

to interpolate the band structure to 128 128 128 and compute the mass tensor at the extrema located in a range from -4.0 to 4.0 w.r.p.t. the Fermi level(!)
of cause you can change those numbers.

3) (unfortuenately) run VASP with nwrite=3; 
you don't have to complete the calculation, it is just needs to print the symmetry operations 
to the OUTCAR which happens before the first self-consistent step.
4) run the code as
$ /path/to/your/elephon/main/release/elephon infile

After running the calculation, you can open the file using python such as with the code snipped below

data = numpy.fromfile("name_of_the_mass_tensor_file", dtype=np.float32).reshape((-1,18))

This will give you a list of extrema in the energy range ewinbnd with their mass tensor.

Here is an explanation of data
data[0,:] = [
pos 	1:  +(-)1 = maximum (minimum) ,
	2: band index in VASP measure ,
	3-5: kx , ky , kz ,
	6: energy value of the band in eV,
	7: eigenvalue 1, (smallest)
	8-10,: eigenvector 1 x, y , z ,
	11,12-14: eigenpair 2,
	15,16-18, eigenpair 3(largest)]

makes 1+1+3+1+4+4+4 = 18 values

units of the k vector are in reciprocal crystal axis of the lattice, i.e. to get in inverse angstroem multiply the reciprocal lattice matrix from the left.
The energy is eV and the mass tensor is eV * AA^2, (if I am not mistaken). We can discuss what units would be desirable.

Please let me know if you have problems
a) getting the source code.
b) following the README to install the source code
c) setting up a real-world calculation.
